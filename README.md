Basic-web-scraper
================

Simple web scraper template. It scrapes the Jeopardy Questions from a J-archive.com page and then outputs it as a json file. It's very easy to modify to suit your needs. You'll need to know Jquery selectors to make this work. 

* Make sure you have node set up first. That is important. 

* Put these files into a directory. Open your terminal window to that directory. 

* Install your dependencies by running (in your terminal): `npm install`

* Open `server.js` and change what you want to. Save the file

* In your terminal run: node `server.js`

* Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081/scrape`

* Go back to your console
